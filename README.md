## 👩‍🎓 Capstone Project
For my final project, I utilized the Action for Health dataset and analyzed measures relating to emergency services and hospital occupancy. My [project proposal](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/Capstone%20Project%20-%20Nova%20Scotia%20Healthcare%20(Action%20for%20Health)/Project%20Proposal.md) includes more details on the data, my objectives and the tools used. I presented my findings in a ***6-minute [report](https://youtu.be/aMrKo2nOu3U).***  

Further, I created a regression model in attempt to predict the number of emergency visits at all hospitals in NS. You can view my model [here](https://youtu.be/Z-BIl2x6siQ). I also created a [data loading tutorial](https://youtu.be/p8fcV-YeuZ8), showing how to load pandas dataframes to MS SQL.

## 🎨 SQL Database Design  
For this assignment, I created a new database in MS SQL with 5 dimension and 2 fact tables, creating a [star schema](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20-%20Star%20Schema%2C%20Data%20Loading%2C%20Queries/StarSchemaScript.ipynb). Then, I [loaded](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20-%20Star%20Schema%2C%20Data%20Loading%2C%20Queries/DataLoading.ipynb) the sample Northwind database into my newly created database, using Data Manipulation Language. The entity relationship diagram for this database can be found [here](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20-%20Star%20Schema%2C%20Data%20Loading%2C%20Queries/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagram.png). Lastly, I have a few [example queries](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20-%20Star%20Schema%2C%20Data%20Loading%2C%20Queries/ExampleQueries.ipynb) for hypothetical business scenarios based on this database.

## 🐍 Python - Data Manipulation using Pandas  
Using pandas, I performed exploratory data analysis on a Kaggle dataset and [cleaned the data](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20-%20%20Data%20Cleaning%20%26%20Modeling/DataCleaning_Example.ipynb) by handling nulls and editing any abends in the data. Additionally, I [modeled](https://github.com/abjumana/Portfolio/blob/main/Python%20-%20%20Data%20Cleaning%20%26%20Modeling/Modeling_Template.ipynb) a Netflix dataset using dictionaries and lookups.
